# Mid-Term-Project-Phase-2-Blender-
This repository contains the PHASE 2 Mid-term project for Graphics and animation tools using Blender.
This repo contains the blender file which contians the 3-D Batman styled character made using Blender.
This is my first time using Blender and I know that the model I have created is not perfect but I am looking forward to improve it.
